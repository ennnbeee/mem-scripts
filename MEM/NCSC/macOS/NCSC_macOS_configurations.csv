Content Filtering - Limit Access to websites by,,Configure to organisational acceptable use policy,"This policy has two options; ""trying to limit access to adult websites"" and ""allowing access to the following websites only"". In high-security environments, the ""allowing access to the following websites"" option should be used and the associated allow list populated with permitted URLs. Allow listing is more effective than deny listing in such environment. For networks not considered high-security, the ""trying to limit access to adult websites"" option should be enabled to limit the content end users can access, however this option is not hollistic and is susceptible to bypasses, such as via proxy websites"
